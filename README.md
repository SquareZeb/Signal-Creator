## How to use:
To use this you can start by opening up the app, going to file, and importing either a single sound file or a whole directory of them.
From there you may change the resolution of the image by setting the X and Y ranges, once you've done that you will hit refresh button and click on the sound file to generate a new resolution image. Now remember larger resolutions will require more time to calculate and process.

## How to export:
Once you feel satisfied you may either export just one or export all of the sounds as images.
